Service Discovery - Netflix Eureka

Netflix Eureka is a REST-based service that is primarily used for locating services for the purpose of load balancing
and failover of middle-tier servers. It is a key component in microservices architecture, enabling services to discover
each other without hard-coded IP addresses or DNS names.

Key Features of Netflix Eureka:
1. Service Registry: Eureka acts as a service registry where microservices can register themselves and discover other
   services. Each service instance registers with Eureka, providing its metadata such as hostname, port, health status,
   and other custom data.
2. Client-Side Load Balancing: Eureka clients can query the registry to get a list of available service instances.
3. Health Checks: Eureka supports health checks to ensure that only healthy instances are returned to clients. Services
   can periodically send heartbeats to Eureka to indicate they are alive.
4. Self-Preservation Mode: In case of network partitions or other issues, Eureka can enter a self-preservation mode
   where it continues to serve requests based on the last known state of the registry, preventing mass eviction of
   services.
5. Scalability: Eureka is designed to be highly available and scalable, allowing multiple instances of the Eureka
   server to run in a cluster.
6. Integration with Spring Cloud: Netflix Eureka is well-integrated with Spring Cloud, making it easy to set up service
   discovery in Spring Boot applications.
